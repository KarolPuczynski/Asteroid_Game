# Asteroid Game
## This project is part of my laboratory assignment, where I implemented new features into the base Asteroid Game using C++.

The following features have been added:
- Player health bar  
- HP bar displayed on asteroids  
- Player score that updates after destroying an asteroid  
- Asteroids break into smaller pieces upon destruction  
- New weapon mode: Shotgun
- Game Over screen
